# bspwm-scripts
The scripts I've created and use on a daily basis with bspwm, may contain auxilary information for use with other software as well.

There wont be tons of extra info here since its not a project necessarily intended for use outside of myself, but feel free to use anything here as you wish.

For my setup everything here is placed inside the `~/.config/bspwm/` directory.

This repo has a license solely for the purpose of clarity, it basically says do what you like, no credit required, no special license requirments, nothing.
